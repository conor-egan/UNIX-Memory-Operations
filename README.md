# UNIX-Memory-Operations
A number of exercises demonstrating UNIX memory concepts. Completed as part of the final grade requirements for
UL Module CE4206 - Operating Systems 2, taught by Dr. Donal Heffernan.

## Memory Operations

Repository consists of 3 separate exercises that demonstrate UNIX memory operations. Each exercise
consists of two programs.

### Exercise 1
The first exercise creates a shared memory object and will write a simple string
message into that object. Another program opens the memory object and
reads the message from that object.

### Exercise 2
The second exercise is similar to the first, it transfers an array of data
instead of a simple string message using a shared memory object.

### Exercise 3
The third exercise maps a file specified by the user to a shared memory object and edits it's first character.
A reader program then displays the file contents.
